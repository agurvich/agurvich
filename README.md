# Hi there! I'm Alex 👋

I'm a data visualization specialist at NASA with a Ph.D. in computational astrophysics.
I love working with Python and JavaScript to create high performance interactive web applications. 
In my free time, I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy as well as performing improv comedy.
