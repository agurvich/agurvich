# Hi there! I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fullstack data engineer & visualizer at NASA with a Ph.D. in computational astrophysics where I primarily build pipelines in Python that feed interactive web applications that I build myself. 
I'm currently based out of DC, and in my free time I volunteer as a core organizer in both [Data Community DC](https://dc2.org) and [Civic Tech DC](https://civictechdc.org). For fun, I do improv comedy with the Washington Improv Theater, play overly complicated board games, and take too many pictures of my dog.

If you're here on my GitHub then you must mean serious business, so I'll drop the buzzwords as much as possible.

## Cool Projects
### ðŸ“Š Interactive Webapps
- [Eclipse Explorer](https://go.nasa.gov/eclipseexplorer): An interactive solar eclipse map for 2023 & 2024 solar eclipses that received over 24 million pageviews and was featured on the front page of NASA.gov! Not sure I'll ever top this one; it took a literal cosmic alignment.
- [Hometown Dashboard](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.ogv/webapps/hometown-dashboard) - Interactive climate dashboard for exploring what long term climate models predict over the next 150 years at ~25 mile spatial resolution. We deployed this on a 65" touch table at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History on the National Mall (where evaluators said it had 5x the average dwell time of other interactives in the museum; just saying)!
- [Climate Legacies](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/webapps/climate-legacies) - A sort of morbid visualization of the generational divide in impacts from climate change based on a popular graphic from the [6th Annual Report of the International Committee on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/figures/summary-for-policymakers/figure-spm-1/). We got commissioned to do this one by the scientist who consulted on the graphic and customized it for his mom's birthday. The app got a lot of play on climate twitter but we never managed to integrate with Zazzle for people to print out their own shirts. 
- [Earth.gov](https://Earth.gov): The digital home for NASA's Earth Information Center, Greenhouse Gas Center, and National Sea Level Rise Center. I got drafted to be the technical lead/stakeholder liaison/scrum product owner for this site in collaboration with [DevSeed](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-config-eic) who are the core developers for the site.

### Stuff I did back in Grad School
- [Firefly](http://firefly.rcs.northwestern.edu) - 3D interactive web visualization application for billions of data points using three.js and WebGL; thanks to an NSF fellowship I got to do this is as part of my thesis and it ended up getting me my job at NASA, so that's pretty neat. 
- [WIND](http://github.com/agurvich/WIND): a GPU-accelerated library for integrating dense networks of stiff coupled differential equations (aka the hard ones) that I built as part of a National Center for Supercomputing Applications fellowship (RIP [Blue Waters](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/project-highlights/blue-waters/), gone but never forgotten).
